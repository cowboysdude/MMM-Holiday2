   #CUSTOM CSS OPTIONS
   
Don't like the colors?  Change them!!  Here are some things you can change by putting them in your custom.css file!


      .MMM-Holiday2 .symbol {
	    color: #c9e4f5;
       }
      
The above only reference font-awesome icons!  They will NOT work for your custom icons....     
       
Use these to change the color of your holidays listing..  the 1st one is for if there is a holidays you can change the txt color to stand out]

        .MMM-Holiday2 .today {
	     color: #54d2e4;

 What color do you want the text in a NON holiday day?  I stick with white myself :)
 
        .MMM-Holiday2 .holiday {
	     color: #fff;
        }
